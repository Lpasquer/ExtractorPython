# Wikipedia Matrix Extractor (2020/2021)

This project is inspired by the project "Wikipedia Matrix" which was made by a group of M1 MIAGE during 2020 & 2021.

# The goal of the project "Wikipedia Matrix Extractor"

Such as the project "Wikipedia Matrix", the goal is to collect data and extract it from Wikipedia's tables. These tables are on some Wikipedia pages. The content of these tables will be stocked in CSV files. 
Last year, the extractor have been made in Java. This year, the project was to create an extractor with another language, we have decided to do it with Python. So we can compare the two extractors to see if they are doing the same job.
Wikipedia's pages are written in two language, HTML and Wikitext. But for our extractor it only reads Wikipedia's pages in HTML format.

# Prerequisite

  - Python IDE : VSCode, etc...
