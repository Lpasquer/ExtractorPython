# Installation using Visual Studio Code

Before doing anything, you will need to download and install Python if you don't have it yet (you can get it on https://www.python.org/downloads/).
Once it is done, you can open a terminal on Windows and start to install the different libraires with the command "pip install NameOfLibrarie" (for example : pip install BeautifulSoup4).
There is a list of the different libraries that you will need : 
  - Pandas
  - BeautifulSoup4
  - Numpy
  
In order to use this project, you will need an IDE, we used VSCode. In VSCode, you will need to install the extension "Python" before opening the project.
