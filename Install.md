# Installation using Visual Studio Code

Before doing anything, you will need to download and install Python if you don't have it yet (you can get it on https://www.python.org/downloads/).
Once it is done, you can open a terminal on Windows and start to install the different libraires with the command "pip install NameOfLibrarie" (for example : pip install BeautifulSoup4).
There is a list of the different libraries that you will need : 
  - Pandas
  - BeautifulSoup4
  - Numpy
  
In order to use this project, you will need an IDE, we used VSCode. In VSCode, you will need to install the extension "Python" before opening the project.
Once it's done, you can test the project by getting the different files. 

Some of us used the application "GitHub Desktop" to get the files when the project is forked. So I can recommend you to use it, it's very easy to use and understandable, you just need to sign in with your actual GitHub account so you will be able to open the project's repository in your external editor (VSCode in this case) and work on it.
